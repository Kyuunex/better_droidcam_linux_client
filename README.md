# A better client for DroidCam on Linux
Because the official one is over-engineered, does not work with Discord, does not work in all Linux distros painlessly and just generally badly done.

# Requirements
+ `adb`
+ `v4l2loopback`
+ `ffmpeg`

If you use Arch Linux and have `yay` installed, you can just do `yay -S adb v4l2loopback-dkms ffmpeg` in terminal.
